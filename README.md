Features:
✅ Simulates rocket motion using Newtonian physics.
✅ Takes user inputs for thrust, mass, fuel burn rate, and flight time.
✅ Implements drag force based on cross-sectional area and air resistance.
✅ Updates velocity and altitude iteratively using small time steps.
✅ Plots altitude vs. time for visualization.

How It Works:
User inputs rocket parameters (thrust, mass, fuel burn rate, etc.).
The simulation updates velocity and altitude at each time step using Newton's laws.
Drag force and fuel consumption are dynamically adjusted.
The altitude vs. time graph is plotted using Matplotlib.
